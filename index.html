                    issues with their computers within the company. I am currently studying to become a Full Stack
                    Developer. I am enrolled through the University of Utah in their Bootcampspot for full stack
                    development. I am excited to take my career to the next level by putting the skills and knowledge I
                    have learned to use <br>
                    Personal Life: I have a wife and a beautifulf daughter who is a blessing in our lives. Together we enjoy going
                    out to movies, restraunts and watching our favourite TV shows. We have a dog that is a
                    huskie/malamute mix and we enjoy every ounce of energy she has to bring.
                    Outside of work and school, I enjoy
                    to be outside. I love hunting, fishing,
                    pickelball, golfing and almost all outdoor sports. Durning the cold season I enjoy playing
                    boardgames and reading books. I love being active and at the same time enjoy time with the family relaxing.
