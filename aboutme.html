                <p class="aboutMe">About Me: I am currently employeed as a Service Desk Analyst. I enjoy working in the
                    field I do and wanted to further my studies for this.
                    I am currently enrolled to become a Full Stack
                    Developer through the University of Utah. I love learning about what you can offer to those around
                    you in this course to make their lives better in one small way. <br>
                    Personal Life: I have a wife and one child who is a blessing in our lives. Together we enjoy going
                    out to movies, restraunts and watching our favourite TV shows. We have a dog that is a
                    huskie/malamute mix and we enjoy every ounce of energy she has to bring.
                    Outside of work and school, I enjoy
                    to be outside. I love hunting, fishing,
                    pickelball, golfing and almost all outdoor sports. Durning the cold season I enjoy playing
                    boardgames and reading books. I love being active and at the same time enjoy time with the family relaxing. </p>
